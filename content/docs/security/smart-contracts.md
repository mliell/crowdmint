# Smart Contracts & Security

CrowdMint is built with a security-first approach, using smart contracts to manage all campaign logic and fund flows.

## Key Principles

CrowdMint is built on audited smart contracts that ensure:

- **Transparency:** All transactions are publicly verifiable on-chain
- **Immutability:** Data cannot be altered once recorded
- **Trustlessness:** No central authority controls the funds
- **Automation:** Smart contracts enforce campaign rules


## Risk Disclosure

While we follow best practices, users should be aware:

- Smart contracts carry inherent risks
- Bugs may lead to fund loss
- Stablecoin value may fluctuate
- Always test with small amounts first
