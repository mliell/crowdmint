# Platform Fees

CrowdMint is designed with a transparent and sustainable fee model, ensuring the continuous operation of the platform and rewarding the community through its Vault system. All fees are charged in USDC, the stablecoin used for all transactions on the platform.  

Our fee model is divided into two main categories, depending on the stage and type of interaction with the funds:

## Campaign Withdrawal Fees (For Creators)

When a campaign creator withdraws the funds raised from a successful (or flexible) campaign within the 6-month grace period after the campaign ends, a small fee is applied:  

 - **Campaign Withdrawal Fee: 0.5% of the total amount withdrawn**. Destination: This fee is directed to the platform fee collector (platformFeeCollector), contributing to the maintenance and development of CrowdMint's infrastructure.   

 > Example: If a creator withdraws 1,000 USDC, 5 USDC (0.5%) will be sent to the platform fee collector, and the creator will receive 995 USDC.

## Vault Withdrawal Fees (For Creators and Donors)

 At the heart of CrowdMint, the Vault is the guardian of unclaimed funds, ensuring that, even in situations of forgetfulness, lost wallets, or unforeseen circumstances, these resources are managed with responsibility, care, and by generating revenue for the community.  
 
If campaign funds (for creators) or refunds (for donors) are not withdrawn within the initial 6-month grace period, they are automatically transferred to the Vault.  

Even after the transfer to the Vault, creators and donors retain the possibility to redeem their funds during the 3-year Vault Lock period. **Upon withdrawal, a total fee of 10% is applied to the principal amount**, strategically distributed as follows: 2% is allocated to the platform for sustainability and development, while the remaining 8% is directed back to the Vault itself, further strengthening the resources that generate revenue for the community.

> Example: If a creator or donor withdraws 1,000 USDC from the Vault:
> 20 USDC (2%) will be sent to the platform fee collector. 80 USDC (8%) will remain in the CrowdMint Vault. The original claimant will receive 900 USDC. 

Upon the conclusion of the 3-year Vault Lock period, should the funds not have been redeemed by creators (for successful campaigns) or donors (for campaigns that did not meet their goal), the total amount will be fully integrated into the Vault's capital. From that moment onward, these resources become a permanent part of the Vault, no longer eligible for withdrawal by their original holders, and will continue to generate revenue for the CrowdMint community.
