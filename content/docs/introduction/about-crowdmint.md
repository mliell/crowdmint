# What is CrowdMint

CrowdMint is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Web3 and powered by the Arc blockchain. It enables creators to launch campaigns and receive support from backers using USDC through their Web3 wallets. All interactions are governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and full user control.

## Our Mission

To empower creators and communities through an open, secure, and transparent crowdfunding infrastructure — without intermediaries, with full user control, and a strong focus on community trust.


## How It Works

Creators launch campaigns by setting goals, deadlines, and optionally a minimum contribution amount. There are two types of campaigns:

- **Goal-Based (All or Nothing)**: The creator only receives the funds if the goal is reached. Otherwise, backers can request a refund.
- **Flexible**: The creator receives all funds raised, even if the goal is not met.

Supporters contribute using USDC on Arc blockchain, and all interactions are recorded on-chain.
