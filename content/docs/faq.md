# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is CrowdMint?
CrowdMint is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Arc Network's blockchain technology. It allows anyone to create campaigns and anyone to back projects they believe in, all using Web3 wallets and the USDC stablecoin.

### Do I need cryptocurrency experience?
No. If you can use a Web3 wallet and send USDC, you’re ready to use CrowdMint. We also provide beginner-friendly guides.

### Is CrowdMint available globally?
Yes, CrowdMint is available to anyone with a Web3 wallet and USDC, regardless of location or nationality.

## Campaigns

### How long can a campaign run?
Creators choose the campaign duration at the time of launch, and it can range from just a few hours to as long as one year. However, most campaigns typically run for 30 to 90 days.

### What’s the difference between goal-based and flexible campaigns?
- **Goal-Based (All or Nothing):** The creator only receives the funds if the campaign reaches its target by the deadline. If the goal isn’t met, backers can request a refund of their contributions.
- **Flexible campaigns:** The creator receives all the funds raised, regardless of whether the campaign reaches its goal or not.

### Can I create multiple campaigns?
Yes! There's no limit to how many campaigns you can launch as a creator.

## Donations

### What's the minimum donation?
By default, there’s no minimum donation — anyone can contribute any amount they wish. However, campaign creators have the option to set a custom minimum donation when launching their campaign. If defined, this amount will be clearly displayed on the campaign page. There’s no maximum limit.

### Are donations refundable?
It depends on the campaign type:
- **Goal-Based campaigns:** Yes, if the campaign does not reach its funding goal by the deadline, backers can request a refund of their contributions.
- **Flexible campaigns:** No, since the creator receives all funds regardless of the goal, donations are not refundable.

### Can I donate more after my initial donation?
Yes, you can contribute as many times as you like to a campaign while it’s still active.

## Security

### Is my wallet safe?
Yes — your wallet is fully under your control at all times. CrowdMint never has access to your private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials. All transactions are initiated and signed directly from your Web3 wallet.
